## Projects

### 1. Coccidiosis Detection

- Description: This repository contains the code for a Chicken Disease Classification App, which uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify chicken fecal images and identify potential diseases. The project incorporates various MLOps concepts to ensure seamless development, reproducibility, and scalability.
- Demo: [See Demo](https://github.com/Shahbazkhan555/chicken-disease-classification/blob/main/chicken-demo.gif)
- Source Code: [GitHub](https://github.com/Shahbazkhan555/chicken-disease-classification)

### 2. Movie Recommendation Engine

- Description: This App is a content-based movie recommendation application that suggests movies to users based on their interests. It utilizes the Bags of Words (BoW) technique and Cosine Similarity to find similarities between movies and recommend those that are most relevant to the user's preferences.
- Demo: [See Demo](https://github.com/Shahbazkhan555/movie-recommender-system/blob/main/movie-recommender-demo.gif)

### 3. Gemstone Price Prediction

- Description: The Gemstone Price Predictor App is a machine learning application that accurately predicts the prices of gemstones based on various features such as carat, dimensions, cut, color, clarity, and more. The app utilizes the powerful CatBoosting Regressor model, which outperformed other models in terms of R2 Score(0.9786) and other factors.
